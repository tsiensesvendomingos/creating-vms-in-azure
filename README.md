<h1>Creating Virtural Machines in Microsoft Azure</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
For everything that was covered in this Portfolio, a Microsoft Azure account is required. This can be obtained by signing up for a free Microsoft Azure Account. A debit or credit card will be required for signup. As of the creation of this page, Azure offers $200 worth of credits to use for a big library of tools that Azure has to offer. These credits are able to create and run the virtual machines we used in the portfolio to simulate the projects we conducted.
